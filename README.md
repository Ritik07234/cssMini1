## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main files:
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML markup for the web page.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the page elements.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language used for creating the structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: Styling to enhance the visual elements of the page.
- **JavaScript** (optional): Can be used for added interactivity if needed.
- **Remixicon**: For icons in the page.
- **External Fonts**: Custom fonts like Gilroy and Source Serif 4.

## Fonts

The project uses custom fonts:
- **Gilroy**: For general text styling.
- **Source Serif 4**: For headings.

To ensure fonts load correctly, place `Gilroy-Medium.otf` and `Source Serif 4.ttf` in the same directory as `style.css`.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the page.
3. If needed, modify the code in `index.html` and `style.css` to adjust content and styles.

## Customization

- **Navigation Links**: The links in the navigation bar (`Find Talent`, `Inspiration`, etc.) can be modified to fit your websiteâ€™s needs.
- **Images and Videos**: Replace the `img` and `video` `src` attributes to showcase different creatives or media content.
- **Fonts and Colors**: Adjust font and color styles in `style.css` to match your preferred aesthetic.
- **Buttons**: The `Log in` and `Sign up` buttons, as well as the primary action button (`Start hiring today`), can be styled or resized as desired.
